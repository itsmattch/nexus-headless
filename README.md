## Alpha Stage Disclaimer

Nexus is currently in the Alpha stage of development. At this time, the main
features of the app are still being created and fine-tuned.

Please note that all versions below 1.0.0 should be considered unstable, and
there might be no compatibility between even minor versions. It's all part of
the process to make everything work perfectly in the future!

## Installation

If you need to install this specific module, you can do so with the following
command:

```bash
composer require itsmattch/nexus-headless
```

For most users, it's recommended to
use [Nexus](https://github.com/itsmattch/nexus) directly, as it comes with all
required dependencies already installed.
